### Extra Functionality

* Tests for all endpoints, including correct output and errors !!Please note that the tests automatically drop the application database!!
* Additional endpoints to view aggregate ratings data for users, stores ('/aggregate/stores' and '/aggregate/users')
* Some front-end validation (e.g. age, rating and id's must be numbers)
* Responsive design (thanks to Bootstrap)
* A nicely styled front end if I may say so myself
* And I think my error handling is pretty good

By the way, "Run This Town" was stuck in my head for the entirety of this assignment.
